// Reflection
// Just will list the order of steps of how I figured things out.  First had to figure out how to get the written contents within an object onto the HTML, and decided that document.getElementById was the best way to go. So create a paragraph element, create a text node, append the text node to the paragraph, and then append the paragraph to the parent element.
// Second step was to figure out how to get a key event work - specifically enter.
// Then had to figure out to have the key event apply to each section within the particular class that I had written, as I wanted each step of story to be written as a user event trigger.
// Once I got that working, I decided to remove the elements of the previous story section and add new ones.  
// The next part (which took me a LONG time to figure out) was three fold - figure out how to add a form to the html via Javascript, then have submit user input, then use said user input for the next part of the story.  The problem was that the forms apparently normally take user input via a submission button, but I instead wanted to submit it via the enter key. And then I wanted to access the input value and use it to determine the next part of the story.  After multiple rounds of attempts and google searching, I finally figured out the above solution.

// Key Events
// Difference between keypress, keydown, keyup
// Most useful resource for understanding key events, enter, and form submit https://www.tjvantoll.com/2013/01/01/enter-should-submit-forms-stop-messing-with-that/

// Objects
// Prototypes vs. Objects
// Creating an object
	// new Object()
	// Object.create() is useful because you can use another premade object (such as one declared with object initializer) as a prototype to create a new object based on the prototype.
	// Object initializer, literal notation - 
		// var o = {
		//   property: function ([parameters]) {},
		//   get property() {},
		//   set property(value) {},
		// };
	// 	Object initializers are expressions, and each object initializer results in a new object being created whenever the statement in which it appears is executed.
	// in my own words: when you use an object initializer, you are creating the object right then and there.  When the code is read, the object is 'expressed'/created right then and there and assigned to the variable associated with it.
	//	Constructor - the difference with constructor from object initializer is that the constructor is very much a template - it does not get read until new is called upon an instance of it.  It is very much a template, and then gets used when new is used, and passed properties.
		// function Car(make, model, year) {
		//   this.make = make;
		//   this.model = model;
		//   this.year = year;
		// }
		// var mycar = new Car("Eagle", "Talon TSi", 1993);
