- Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

1.  Create a repo.  Go to Github, and there is a little icon on the top right that has a plus sign.  Click on it and name a repo!  Then copy the link located on the right side bar.

2.  Clone it local.  Now that you have a repo on the web, you have to get it onto your computer.  You can easily do that through your terminal (ideally you have your git installed and github already linked).  All you have to do is type "git clone" and then paste in that website link that you copied.  Boom, done!

- Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the not just the output of the code is available, but the code itself is viewable/available.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open Source is a great concept, but of course the entire world can't run on that and make money.  Communisim sounded like utopia on paper as well.  It's good that open source can work well in some situations, and can benefit both the distributer/creator/user.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses exist because open source is still a very nebulous term, as such I think that licenses serve the purpose of clarifying what open source actually means. Licenses can also protect the user/creator of the software.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I have been exposed to open source before, but it was nice to get clarification on the MIT license, and why DBC uses it.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
