<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	Easy!  Have done HTML before.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	Google is my friend.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	Good, CSS is where it's at for that type of stuff.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	HTML is great for organizing content, but terrible for doing any real formatting.  But that's the intent anyways.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	Just practice?
