**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

My site's primary goal is to showcase my work and projects.  My site will show my projects, and link to them, as well as have a little bit of background information about what I do.  

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience are recruiters/people who are interested in my work and are looking to hire.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary action would be for someone to contact me, with interest in job hiring or my work experience.  I guess though that in order for that to happen, they would have to see my portfolio/work experience, so that would be the feed in to that action.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

The main thing people should know is that design and UX don't exist in a vacuum. Since products are used by humans, not machines, they should be made for humans.  Also that UX and design is much, much more than the colors on a page - there is an entire cognitive science behind it (yeah HCI!).  UX and design are about information architecture, about user task flow, and then about aesthetics (although the asthetics should be directly informed from the functionality)

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?** 

UX design is the field of figuring out how to best design products for human interaction experience.  This is definitely not limited to just computers.  It is valuable because in order for something to not be able to use a product, but actually enjoy using it.  

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

None.  I've done most of this before, and fairly enjoy it.  I think that you could include some more resources on information architecture, especially since you are having people to do sitemaps (albeit simple ones).
