**What does puts do?**

Puts returns no value and prints the output to the console on a new line.  Is useful sometimes for double checking to see whether or not the correct item is being returned. 

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

Integer is a whole number, either postive or negative.  Float is a decimal.

**What is the difference between float and integer division?**

Float division allows you to divide decimals and get a decimal in return, whereas integer division will give you a whole number (the floor of the whole number).

**How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

Sometimes you don't have numbers that are perfect whole numbers - they are fractions, or decimals.  As such, float division allows for numbers like that, and allows for the answers not to be perfect whole numbers.  However, integer division only accepts and returns whole numbers, which is good for figuring out the value of non-fractionable items.

```ruby
puts 365*24
puts 60*24*365*10

```


**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

Ruby handles all the basic math operators pretty succinctly and very close to math.

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**

Integers are whole numbers and floats are decimals.

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**

Integer division is when dividing by whole numbers, float division is when you divide by decimals and have to deal with floating point numbers.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings are series of characters, and are for writing anything to the screen.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

Local variables are used within a method, and you would use them if you just need a variable inside of a method.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**
Yep.  Pretty basic.
