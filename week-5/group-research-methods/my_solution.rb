# Person 4
def my_array_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete_if do |item| 
    item.to_s.include? thing_to_delete
  end
  source
end

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete(thing_to_delete)
  source
end



# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I used the method delete, which removes an item (but doesn't return the modified hash or array, so you have to do that)
# Also used the method delete_if which gives delete a conditional
# And lastly used the method include? which double checks if the object has the secondary object located inside of it (in this case a string)
# Also used the to_s method to make sure I didn't get a fixnum error when iterating through the loop.


# Person 5

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
