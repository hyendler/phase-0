# Notes:
# Game play will be a text based console RPG crime noir game.
# BIG THANKS TO: Ariella Yendler, for helping me write the script.
# Game play description, as from Learn Ruby the Hard Way: 
# http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex43.html
# "The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map."
# Note on refactored code: I first tried to write the code myself, not based on the textbook's code.

# Pseudocode
# Scenes:
# Palace Hotel
# Corner Store
# Dark Alley
# Top of Coit Tower
# Golden Gate Bridge

# Game set up:
# Map
# Engine

# Actions:
# Fight
# Dodge
# Interrogate
# Inspect

# Palace Hotel
# 	First scene, something terrible happens, and sets the detective on the path
# 	Inspect
# 	Interrogate
# 	Something else?
# Dark Alley
# 	Inspect
# 	Interrogate
# Corner Store
# 	Inspect
# 	Interrogate
# 	gets to choose from a weapon (gun, knife, pack of a cigarettes)
# Top of Coit Tower
# 	Riddle or puzzle or lock, with guesses
# 	If get it, then get inside
# 	inspect, find a person
# 	interrogate, person points them towards Golden Gate Bridge
# 	if donâ€™t get it, sent back to either a different part of the game or another new scene to find the answer, and make sure it leads back to coit tower to try again
# Golden Gate Bridge
# 	Final Scene
# 	Fight
# 	If has cigarette, dies 0 probability
# 	otherwise fight
# 	probability depends on weapon chosen

# MAP
# purpose of map: to build a scene list, to export to the engine to 'play'
# 
# SCENE
# purpose of scene?
# 
# Can write this two different ways - a general map/game engine, or one specifically for this particular game.  Start with writing one for this particular game, and then see what I can do.

# how to play a scene:
# create a new engine (engine is a class that has a play method)
# engine or map needs to create new instances of each scene, that then can be passed around.
# for example, if a_map = Map.new
# pass engine.play(an instance of a scene class)

# REFLECTION
# ARGV, $stdin, STDIN
# Learn Ruby the Hard Way used $stdin.gets.chomp, which I didn't recognize, so I went down the rabbit hole of learning about.  But then it started talking about ARGV, which I also didn't know.  As such, ARGV is an array (but also a constant) that stores all the arguments passed into a program (but not the name of the program itself.)  It is useful because you specifiy the arguments upfront when running a file.  ex: ruby ex1.rb argument1 argument2 argument 3.  ARGV would be ["argument1", "argument 2", "argument3"]
# So if you passed in arguments into ARGV, gets.chomp will read ARGV first.  As such, if you want to ensure that gets.chomp will read the user input, you need to put $stdin, as the gets method will fall back to $stdin and not STDIN.
# But wait.  What's the difference between STDIN and $stdin?  STDIN is a constant, and $stdin is a global variable, but what is the functional difference between the two? Well, because $stdin is a variable, it can get reassigned.  STDIN can get reassigned as well, but will have no effect unless a 3rd party method uses STDIN.  
# As such, use $stdin.gets.chomp in order to make sure that the user input is being read.
# And as a general note, standard input is the steam where input for a computer is held.  The input is stored in a variable.

# Class vs. module
# Module is a block of code that has functions or variables in it, and you can save it as an individual file and you can import that file using require, and call functions or variables using the dot operator.  (could also probably not need to use require and just have a module within the file and use dot notation after to access functions/variables inside.)
# Difference between module and a class:  Only one module exists for the entire program, whereas classes can be instantiated and called into objects, which are just many copies of the original class.  Not to confuse instantiation with initialization.  Instantiation is calling a new object from the class ie object = MyClass.new(), whereas initialize is a function that actually creates the object itself, with whatever variables you set.
# Quesiton: but does a class need an initialize method?  What if there are no instance variables that need initializing?  According to https://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/52191792f10c601d4f003a2a, you can still instantiate an object from a class without the initialize method, but no special code will be run at the creation of the object.

# Class inheirtance
# can be indicated by class child < parent notation
# Implicit inheirtance.  Actions on the child imply an action on the parent.  If you put a function in the base class, then all subclasses will automatically get those features.
# Override Explicitily. Actions on the child override the action on the parent.  When you have the same function in both the parent and the child class, the child class function will prevail due to explicit override.
# Alter before or after.  Actionson the child alter the action on the parent.  Even in an explicit override, you can call the parent version of the same function if you write super() in the method.
# Most common usage of super is in the child's initialize.  Set the child's variables in initialize, and then having the parent initialize after.  
# Question. Here is the code from the chapter:
# class Child < Parent
# 	  def initialize(stuff)
#         @stuff = stuff
#         super()
#     end
# end
# Wouldn't it be better to put super() before initializing the child's variables?  What's the difference?

# Composition
# Rather than rely on implicit inheritance, can just use other classes or modules inside of 
# 
# 
# 
# 
#
