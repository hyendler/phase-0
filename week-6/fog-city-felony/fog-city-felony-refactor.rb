# Completed by Hanah Yendler for DBC Phase 0.
# This took me [16 hours] to complete (still not finished, want to fix/add new features).

# Notes:
# Game play will be a text based console RPG crime noir game.
# BIG THANKS TO: Ariella Yendler, for helping me write the script.  Also thanks to P.G. Wodehouse for some inspirational insults for the death scene.
# Game play description, as from Learn Ruby the Hard Way: 
# http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex43.html
# "The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map."
# Note on the code: I first tried to write the code for the game play/map/engine by myself, not based on the textbook's code. However, I couldn't riddle out the logic behind/get it to work, so I ended up using the code from the textbook.  However, I have  written out the Map and Engine classes out in pseudocode (this particular pseudocode is located next the classes themselves, not in my actual pseudocode located directly below- that is evidence my ramblings while trying to figure out the logic on my own.) in order to better understand the mechanics.  

# Pseudocode
# Scenes:
# Palace Hotel
# Corner Store
# Dark Alley
# Death
# Safe 
# Golden Gate Bridge

# Game set up:
# Map
# Engine

# Actions:
# Fight
# Dodge
# Interrogate
# Inspect

# Palace Hotel
# 	First scene, something terrible happens, and sets the detective on the path
# 	Inspect
# 	Interrogate
# 	Something else?
# Dark Alley
# 	Inspect
# 	Interrogate
# Corner Store
# 	Inspect
# 	Interrogate
# 	gets to choose from a weapon (gun, knife, pack of a cigarettes)
# Safe
# 	Riddle or puzzle or lock, with guesses
# 	If get it, then get inside
# 	inspect, find a person
# 	interrogate, person points them towards Golden Gate Bridge
# 	if donâ€™t get it, sent back to either a different part of the game or another new scene to find the answer, and make sure it leads back to coit tower to try again
# Golden Gate Bridge
# 	Final Scene
# 	Fight
# 	If has cigarette, dies 0 probability
# 	otherwise fight
# 	probability depends on weapon chosen

# MAP
# purpose of map: to build a scene list, to export to the engine to 'play'
# Can write this two different ways - a general map/game engine, or one specifically for this particular game.  Start with writing one for this particular game, and then see what I can do.

# SCENE
# purpose of scene?

# ENGINE
# how to play a scene:
# create a new engine (engine is a class that has a play method)
# engine or map needs to create new instances of each scene, that then can be passed around.
# for example, if a_map = Map.new
# pass engine.play(an instance of a scene class)
#access the specific scene object and gets it to play
#but then a thing will be returned, so how to capture that?  Where does the return go?
# when one has two classes, and one class initializes another class and then a method from that and then something is returned, how do you capture a returned thing?
# nvm, got it.  when scene.enter is called, that in and of itself will return the next scene.  the only problem then is to have it recursively called onto itself. aka scene.enter.enter.enter etc. 
# note: doesn't work. because enter is not a local variable method for corner_store for DarkAlley object.  Should have known.
# for each scene in the map, have scene enter.  when it returns the next scene, put that inside of map and have it recursively do it again?
# only need to pass map the start scene, because after that it should be self population.
# when engine.play is started, load opening scene.  Then that opening scene will return something, 
#

class Scene
	def enter()
	end
end

# purpose of detective class (which doesn't exist in the Learn Ruby the Hard way game) is to store information on what weapon the player chooses for the detective, and then call it later.  In order for this to be accessible to multiple different objects, it gets initialized to a global variable. (I don't know if this the best way to do this, but it's the only way I could get it to work)

# Pseudocode explaining Map and Engine
# Map creates key 'codes' for creating new objects of the scene classes when called, and the rest of Map serves to convert key 'codes' returned to Engine from a Scene object and convert it to the correct new scene object.  It also sets the opening scene, which is the string passed into Map when Map is first initialized.
# Engine gets passed an object of the Map class that was initialized, which contains the key code conversion hash, the start scene, and the associated methods.  From that, Engine sets the current scene to the opening scene (taken from Map), and sets the last scene to the scene object that will return "the end".  And then the method has a stop break, in that while the current scene does not equal the last scene value, the current scene gets set to the next scene object from the returned key code from the previous scene object.  The scene object gets 'played out' on line 115 when enter method is called on the current scene.

# Additional game features that I want to implement:
# refactor combination lock code
# being able to have more advanced user input - ie if there is a misspelling, then prompt the user for another entry, or if there is capitalization or extra spaces, etc. 
# being able to hit enter to load the next puts line
# blinking in console as a loader/waiting indication?  Is that even possible?
# allow someone to choose their own detective name for the story, and give them options to do so otherwise.
# possibly need to add one more scene (dark alley returns)
# add secret shortcodes in the game
# Also, do I need to add more to the scene object or is it fine as is?

# REFLECTION
# ARGV, $stdin, STDIN
# Learn Ruby the Hard Way used $stdin.gets.chomp, which I didn't recognize, so I went down the rabbit hole of learning about.  But then it started talking about ARGV, which I also didn't know.  As such, ARGV is an array (but also a constant) that stores all the arguments passed into a program (but not the name of the program itself.)  It is useful because you specifiy the arguments upfront when running a file.  ex: ruby ex1.rb argument1 argument2 argument 3.  ARGV would be ["argument1", "argument 2", "argument3"]
# So if you passed in arguments into ARGV, gets.chomp will read ARGV first.  As such, if you want to ensure that gets.chomp will read the user input, you need to put $stdin, as the gets method will fall back to $stdin and not STDIN.
# But wait.  What's the difference between STDIN and $stdin?  STDIN is a constant, and $stdin is a global variable, but what is the functional difference between the two? Well, because $stdin is a variable, it can get reassigned.  STDIN can get reassigned as well, but will have no effect unless a 3rd party method uses STDIN.  
# As such, use $stdin.gets.chomp in order to make sure that the user input is being read.
# And as a general note, standard input is the steam where input for a computer is held.  The input is stored in a variable.


# Class vs. module
# Module is a block of code that has functions or variables in it, and you can save it as an individual file and you can import that file using require, and call functions or variables using the dot operator.  (could also probably not need to use require and just have a module within the file and use dot notation after to access functions/variables inside.)
# Difference between module and a class:  Only one module exists for the entire program, whereas classes can be instantiated and called into objects, which are just many copies of the original class.  Not to confuse instantiation with initialization.  Instantiation is calling a new object from the class ie object = MyClass.new(), whereas initialize is a function that actually creates the object itself, with whatever variables you set.
# Quesiton: but does a class need an initialize method?  What if there are no instance variables that need initializing?  According to https://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/52191792f10c601d4f003a2a, you can still instantiate an object from a class without the initialize method, but no special code will be run at the creation of the object.

# Class inheirtance
# can be indicated by class child < parent notation
# Implicit inheirtance.  Actions on the child imply an action on the parent.  If you put a function in the base class, then all subclasses will automatically get those features.
# Override Explicitily. Actions on the child override the action on the parent.  When you have the same function in both the parent and the child class, the child class function will prevail due to explicit override.
# Alter before or after.  Actionson the child alter the action on the parent.  Even in an explicit override, you can call the parent version of the same function if you write super() in the method.
# Most common usage of super is in the child's initialize.  Set the child's variables in initialize, and then having the parent initialize after.  
# Question. Here is the code from the chapter:
# class Child < Parent
# 	  def initialize(stuff)
#         @stuff = stuff
#         super()
#     end
# end
# Wouldn't it be better to put super() before initializing the child's variables?  What's the difference?

# Composition

# Instance Variables

# Global Variables

# Exiting code
